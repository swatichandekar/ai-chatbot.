# ai-chatbot.
This is a Flask-based AI chatbot app that connects to Google Sheets using a service account. Users enter an ID via a web form, and the app checks the sheet for matching records, displaying results or errors. Itâ€™s ideal for quick lookups like customer support, student records, or membership verification.
